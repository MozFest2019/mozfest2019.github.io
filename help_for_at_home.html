    <h1>Hi there, session participant!</h1>

    <p>A lot of focus when you're designing a MozFest session is to work on post-mozfest participation, so here I've compiled some detailed information for downloading your webpage code, editing it, and sending it back to the web - meaning you can continue to work on your page even though MozFest is over!</p>
<p>The instructions aren't fully finished yet, so for full detail, come back to check on this page in a few days time!</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Downloading your code</h2>
    
        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>If your computer is a <strong>linux</strong> computer, that makes everything very simple! You need to go to the <a href="http://mozfest2019.github.io/Setup_Script.sh">Setup_Script</a> and download it by pressing <strong>SAVE/SAVE-AS</strong> in your webbrowser toolbar (or maybe by pressing <strong>CTRL-S</strong>)</p>
    
        <p>Now, go to the <strong>terminal</strong> - the chances are you know how to find it (if not google it) and navigate (using the cd command, again you may need to use google) to the <strong>Downloads</strong> folder (or wherever you saved the Setup_Scipt). Now, type: <strong>./Setup_Script.sh</strong></p>
    
    <p>If this doesn't work you may need to type <strong>chmod +x Setup_Script.sh</strong></p>
    
        <p>Finally, type <strong>cd mozfest2019.github.io</strong> and <strong>./Setup</strong>, pressing <strong>CTRL-C</strong> to cancel it when it asks for the name of your project. (As this runs the setup software without creating a new project.) </p>
        <h3>MacOS</h3>
        <p>For MacOS, you can try two out <strong>both</strong> the Linux and Windows methods. Look for the mac terminal by searching the applications, and try typing <strong>brew install git</strong> in the terminal before running Setup_Script. It may not work - if not, please feel free to contact me - see my <a href="http://techfun4all.github.io/contact">contact page</a> on my website!</p>
        <p>If that doesn't work, you my want to try the windows method!</p>
        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, there isn't an easy method for windows. You're free to experiment with <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">this,</a> which you have to use with the Windows Command Prompt, or even this <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Desktop version.</a> If you wish to try out either of these, I'm very happy to help! Just send me an email, and we can get onto it! However, the easy way to do it is as follows:</p>
        <p>To download, we are using the same method as getting the Setup_Script with linux. You need to go to your webpage (via the <a href="http://mozfest2019.github.io/">Main Page</a>) and download it by pressing <strong>SAVE/SAVE-AS</strong> in your webbrowser toolbar (or maybe by pressing <strong>CTRL-S</strong>)</p>
        <p>Then, in the <strong>webbrowser URL bar</strong> at the top (the bit that has links like https://www.google.com) type <a href="#">http://mozfest2019.github.io/[your webpage name]/style.css</a> and repeat the downloading process!</p>
        
        
<h2>Editing your page</h2>
                <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>To edit your code in linux, open the mozfest2019.github.io <strong>folder</strong> in a file explorer, and open <strong>style.css</strong> and <strong>index.html</strong> up in a text/code <strong>editor</strong>. style.css is the CSS file, and index.html is the HTML file. You can also open them up in a <strong>webbrowser</strong> to view changes.
        </p>
                <h3>MacOS</h3>
        <p>Again, you can either use the linux instructions (if they work) or the windows ones.</p>
                <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>With editing the code files in windows, it's quite similar to linux. After downloading your code files, open them in both a text/code <strong>editor</strong> and a <strong>webbrowser</strong>. Edit in the text editor, and SAVE and RELOAD in the browser to view changes!
        </p>
<h2>Rescources</h2>
<p>The resources I provided in the session - <strong>the powerpoint, and all the helpsheets,</strong> will soon be found in a google drive folder - I'll set this up as soon as possible!</p>

<h2>Sending it back to the web</h2>
                        <h3>Linux</h3>
<p>With linux, its quite easy to send your code files back to the web. Go back to the <strong>terminal,</strong> navigate into your project's space, and type: <strong>./SendToTheWeb --all</strong></p>
        <p>Follow the instructions, and in a minute or so, check the internet - your page should be all-new!</p>
        
                        <h3>MacOS</h3>
        <p>Again, you can either use the linux instructions (if they work) or the windows ones.</p>
        
                <h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, as I mentioned, there isn't an easy way to do all this with windows, so the best solution I can come up with to date is if you send me an <strong>email</strong> containing your <strong>name, project name, and file/s</strong> you want on the web, I'll put them up there as soon as I can. My email is on my <a href="http://techfun4all.github.io/contact">contact page</a> on my website! 
        </p>
        <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
        <p>Coming soon too!</p>
